title: "52 Card Shuffle Matcher"
description: "The chances of two decks of cards being in the same order is 1/52!. That number is so large it hurts."
longDescription: "While coming to terms with how ridiculously large 52! was, I decided to write some code to see whether I, in my measly lifetime could shuffle two decks of cards in the same order. Please check out the GitHub repo and enjoy! If you ever manage to shuffle the full 52 deck and get a match, email me urgently at 52@johnabood.com"
